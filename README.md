# Data Science Lab Projects - WorldQuant University
Welcome to my repository showcasing the culmination of my hands-on Data Science training at WorldQuant University! This collection highlights my expertise gained through eight end-to-end Data Science projects, covering cutting-edge techniques and real-world applications. Below is an overview of the skills and concepts I mastered through these projects, designed to demonstrate my proficiency in data science and machine learning to potential collaborators, employers, or curious minds.

# Project Overview
1. The Data Science Lab at WQU equipped me with practical, industry-relevant skills through a rigorous curriculum. My projects focused on:
2. ETL Pipelines: Designed and implemented robust Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines to process and clean complex datasets, ensuring data integrity and usability for downstream analysis.
3. Supervised & Unsupervised Machine Learning: Built and evaluated advanced ML models, including regression, classification, and clustering algorithms, to solve diverse predictive and exploratory tasks.
4. Web Application Development: Engineered end-to-end web apps, from designing intuitive user interfaces to deploying scalable solutions, integrating data science models for real-time insights.
5. End-to-End Workflow: Executed full-cycle data science projects, from data acquisition and preprocessing to model deployment and visualization, delivering actionable results.
